# Design Patterns and Architectural Patterns

Questions to ask about design patterns

  - Can you describe the pattern and how to use them?

  - How do I use them?
   
  - What use cases do they solve?
  
  - In which cases are they not helpful or counter productive?
  
  - Can I list the trade-offs between using this pattern and something else?

Ah, you read until the end. So I'll state an opinion here:
