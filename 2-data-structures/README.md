#Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

    a. Know when to use one data structure over another
    
        -So you need to know the basic operations time complexity

            -Access, Search, Insertion, Deletion

    b. Know the space complexity

    c. Know how to implement them in the language you are using 


  
  1. Data Structures to Know:
      
      a. Array and Dynamic arrays (plus methods on them)

      b. Trees (particularly BST)

          -BST

          -AVL Trees

          -Treaps 

      c. Hashtables (dictionaries are a type of hashtable)
          
          -hash functions: for hash mapping, what's hashmapping? Explain.

              --* What types exist? 

              --*complex ones vs simpler ones

          -hash buckets (what are they?)
            
              --* Typically arrays

          -Dealing with collisions (methods):

              -Chaining

              -Linear probing

      d. Heaps
          
          -Max Heap

          -Min Heap

      e. Stacks

      f. Queues & Deques

      g. LinkedLists

          -Singly Linked

          -Doubly Linked
