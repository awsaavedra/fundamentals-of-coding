#objects

  superclass
   
    -subclasses
   
      -method overriding

  objects are instantiations of a class
    
    objects KNOW things (instance variables)
    
    objects DO things (methods)
    
    
  A class is a blueprint for an object, aka, a factory that produces objects 

  
  How do you create and object an object?
    two classes: class and the tester class (class Dog, class DogTest)


  main method uses:
    
    1) to TEST your real class

    2) to launch/start your Java app

    key idea: real java apps are nothing but objects talking to other objects
