# How Objects Behave

  a. State affects behavior, and vice versa.

    i)Objects have a behavior that acts on its state: the idea is simply that
    
    the class has the same methods but the methods can behave differently
    
    depending on the values of the instance variables (state)
        
        e.g. different types of dogs have different barks
    
    ii) A class describes what an object KNOWS and DOES
