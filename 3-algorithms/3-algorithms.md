# Algorithms

##The book I recommend: Steven S. Skiena The Algorithm Design Manual
  
  - for implementing the data structures and algorithms I would use a Static
    language like Java/C++ (plenty of books on implementation)

    1. Sorting Algorithms: Know time and space complexity

        a. Quicksort

        b. Mergesort

        c. Timsort

        d. Heapsort

        e. Bubblesort 

        f. Insertion Sort

        g. That's enough, who asks about other sorts? Seriously...

    2. Heap operations

      a. Linked List (sorted and unsorted)

      b. Binary Heap (others exist, up to you for exotic stuff) 

    3. Graph Traversal

      a. Depth first search

      b. Breadth first search

      c. Binary Tree Traversals

        i) Preorder

        ii) Postorder

        iii) Inorder


      d. Shortest Path algorithms
        
        i) Dijkstra's algorithm
