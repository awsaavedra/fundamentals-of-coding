# Object Oriented Programming & Object Oriented Design from A to Z 

  ## YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
    
    A)Have a definition of the idea/concept w/o examples
    B)Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly
  
 Â 1. The Basic terms:
  
    a.Class
    
      a.Base class, Subclass, superclass
      
      b.Abstract Base Class (and difference from concrete class)
        
        -abstract method
      
    b.Inheritance
      
        a.is a, explain it
      
    c.Class has...
      
        i.Instance variables (things a class knows about) -- State
      
        ii.Methods (things a class does) -- Behavior
      
    d.Polymorphism (v. Overriding or Overloading)
      
    e.Composition/aggregation
      
        i.Has a, explain it
      
        ii.Can an object be composed of multiple things? 
        
        iii.What about multiple inheritance?
      
    f.Multiple inheritance
      
    g.Encapsulation
      
        i. Why do you need it?
        
        ii. What do you use it for?
      
    h.Interface ( aka  protocol)
      
        a. Know the difference between interface and abstract class
      
    j.Method
           
           i.Overriding
           
           ii.Overloading (vs. overriding)
          
           iii.Signatures (What is included in one)
           
           vi.Visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
      
    k.Objects briefly explained
      
        i) An object is a specific instance of a class
          ex) 
            *class: Mammal
              **subclass: 
                ***Zebra  inherits from mammal
                ***instance variables: number of legs 
                ****methods: running (from movement)
                    **instantiate the class zebra and create Tom
                    **Tom: 
                    *****instance variable: Tom has 4 legs
                    *****method: Tom runs at 20 MPH
     
    l.Objects
      
        i.Singleton
      
        ii.Initalizer
      
        iii.Constructor
          
          -Overloading
 
          -When are they called?
          
          -Why would you use one instead of an accessor(setter method)?
          
        vi.Instantiation

        v.Initialization

  2.Object Oriented Design (OOD):
    
    a.For the OO design weeder question, have them describe:
       
        a.What classes they would define.
       
        b.What methods go in each class (including signatures).
       
        c.What the class constructors are responsible for.
       
        d.What data structures the class will have to maintain.
       
       e.Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem
    
    b. Some examples (thanks Steve Yegge):
    
        a. Model the Animal kingdom as a class system
      
        b. Find some online and try to build the design from scratch
    
    c.OOD Concepts:
    
        a. KNOW EACH ONE DOWN COLD: Define it, have examples, and why/when to use OOD vs. other 
      
        b.Paradigms (the last goal is a rather advanced thing, don't worry too much)
      
        c.Robustness
      
        d.Adaptability
      
        e.Reusability
    
    d. Object Oriented Design Principles (OODP):
    
        i)Modularity
        
        ii)Abstraction
      
        iii)Encapsulation
