OP & OOD from A to Z 

  **YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO**:
    
    --*Have a definition of the idea/concept w/o examples
    --*Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly 
  
  1. **The Basic terms:**
  
    a.**Class**: 
    
      a. Base class, Subclass , superclass, 
      
      b. abstract base class (and difference from concrete class)
        
        -abstract method
      
    b.**inheritance**
      
        a.is a, explain it

      
    c. **class** has...
      
        a.instance variables (things a class knows about)
      
        b. methods (things a class does)
      
    d.**Polymorphism** (v. overriding or overloading)
      
    e.**Composition/aggregation**
      
        a.has a, explain it
      
        b. Can an object be composed of multiple things? What about mult inheritance?
      
    f. **Multiple inheritance** and which languages have it
      
    g. **Encapsulation**
      
        a. Why do you need it?
      
    h. **Interface** ( aka  protocol)
      
        a. Know the difference between interface and abstract class
      
    j.**METHOD**...
           
           a.**overriding**
           
           b.**overloading**(vs. overriding)
          
           c.**signatures (What is included in one)
           
           d.visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
      
    k.Objects briefly explained
      
        i) An object is a specific instance of a class
          ex) 
            *class: Mammal
              **subclass: 
                ***Zebra  inherits from mammal
                ***instance variables: number of legs 
                ****methods: running (from movement)
                    **instantiate the class zebra and create Tom
                    **Tom: 
                    *****instance variable: Tom has 4 legs
                    *****method: Tom runs at 20 MPH
     
    l.**Objects**
      
        a.Singleton
      
        b.Initalizer
      
        c.constructor
      
        d.instantiation

        e. adding more later...

  2. **Object oriented Design (OOD)**:
    
    a.For the OO design weeder question, have them describe:
       
        a.What classes they would define.
       
        b.What methods go in each class (including signatures).
       
        c.What the class constructors are responsible for.
       
        d.What data structures the class will have to maintain.
       
       e.Whether any Design Patterns are applicable to this problem
    
    b. Some examples (thanks Steve Yegge):
    
        a. Model the Animal kingdom as a class system
      
        b. Find some online and try to build the design from scratch
    
    c.**OOD Concepts**:
    
        a. KNOW EACH ONE DOWN COLD: Define it, have examples, and why/when to use OOD vs. other 
      
        b. paradigms (the last goal is a rather advanced thing, don't worry too much)
      
        c.Robustness
      
        d.Adaptability
      
        e.Reusability
    
    d. Object oriented design principles (OODP):
    
        i)Modularity
        
        ii)Abstraction
      
        iii)Encapsulation
